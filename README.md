This is repository is aimed to show examples around java concurrency and its best practices. 

As a starter, I am going to follow Java Concurrency tutorial by Jenkov. <br/> 
http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/index.html

I will also take useful notes and post it here.


<b>History:</b><br/>

Back in old days,
# Computer had a single CPU
# Capable of only executing single program at a time.
# Single CPU was shared between programs.
# Operating System would switch between running program, and executing each of them for a little while before switching.
